## scripts
Author's mini-projects that do not deserve their own repository.

All scripts with **sh** [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) are POSIX-compliant!
*(works under awesome [Dash](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Dash)!)*

Scripts are sorted in groups of dirs, every script contains short description.\
Almost every, at least a little flexible script additionally has USAGE-HELP via `-h|--help`.
