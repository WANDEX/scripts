#!/bin/sh
# this version is specific for the 'Twitch Live Channels' extension:
# 'https://github.com/s4my/TwitchLiveChannels'
# I moved to this extension because twitch stopped sending me notifications. :(
#
# Change notification text that stream is started with full stream path at body
# and add ACTION into notification.
#
## MEMO:
## TLC sends notification for each new appearing live channel from the user's followings.
## -> mimic behavior when notifications are sent for only specific channels.
## => show notification only for channels listed in the file (each channel name on its own line).
##
##
## NOTE: to get list of channels, for which you enabled notifications:
## open: 'https://www.twitch.tv/settings/notifications'
## following is the JS code to paste into the web developer console on the page (F12):
## ``` // JS BEG
# // to get list of the channels for which notifications are disabled (just for reference)
# // var disabled = document.querySelectorAll("[checked=''][disabled='']")
# var enabled = document.querySelectorAll("[checked='']:not([disabled=''])")
# array = []
# for (var i = 0; i < enabled.length; i++) {
#     // .textContent & .innerText gives the same result.
#     array.push(enabled.item(i).labels.item(0).textContent)
# }
# var mulstr = array.join("\n") // each on its own line
# mulstr // to copy/paste into the file
## ``` // JS END

set -e
bname=$(basename "$0")

# shellcheck disable=SC2034 # appears unused
{ # {} to apply these ^ rules to the nested:
appname="$1"
summary="$2"
body="$3"
icon="$4"

}

# toggle behavior of showing notifications (ALL/ONLY LISTED)
# 1 - show all, otherwise suppress notifications of the not listed channels.
TLC_SHOW_ALL="${TLC_SHOW_ALL:-0}"

## HACK: Extension sends channel name, not channel login.
##       Channel login is the actual thing used in construction of the channel $url.
##       Considering this, script cannot work properly for channels which login is different.
##       Case is ignored, but this is all.
##
## original notification format at the time of writing the script:
## s: 'Twitch Live Channels'
## b: '<b>LIRIK</b> is Live streaming Just Chatting'
