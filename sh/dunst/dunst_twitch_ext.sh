#!/bin/sh
# this version is specific for the 'Twitch Live Channels' extension:
# 'https://github.com/s4my/TwitchLiveChannels'
# I moved to this extension because twitch stopped sending me notifications. :(
#
# Change notification text that stream is started with full stream path at body
# and add ACTION into notification.
#
## MEMO:
## TLC sends notification for each new appearing live channel from the user's followings.
## -> mimic behavior when notifications are sent for only specific channels.
## => show notification only for channels listed in the file (each channel name on its own line).
##
##
## NOTE: to get list of channels, for which you enabled notifications:
## open: 'https://www.twitch.tv/settings/notifications'
## following is the JS code to paste into the web developer console on the page (F12):
## ``` // JS BEG
# // to get list of the channels for which notifications are disabled (just for reference)
# // var disabled = document.querySelectorAll("[checked=''][disabled='']")
# var enabled = document.querySelectorAll("[checked='']:not([disabled=''])")
# array = []
# for (var i = 0; i < enabled.length; i++) {
#     // .textContent & .innerText gives the same result.
#     array.push(enabled.item(i).labels.item(0).textContent)
# }
# var mulstr = array.join("\n") // each on its own line
# mulstr // to copy/paste into the file
## ``` // JS END

## HACK: Extension sends channel name, not channel login.
##       Channel login is the actual thing used in construction of the channel $url.
##       Considering this, script cannot work properly for channels which login is different.
##       Case is ignored, but this is all.
##       To workaround this go to: 'HACK ALIAS'
##
## original notification format at the time of writing the script:
## s: 'Twitch Live Channels'
## b: '<b>LIRIK</b> is Live streaming Just Chatting'

dump_vars() {
    printf "s: '%s'\nb: '%s'\n\n" "$summary" "$body" >> ~/dump_tlc_log.txt
}

## uncomment for debug (if you suspect that notification format has been changed)
# dump_vars

# sed get only channel name inside surrounding: <b> </b>
twitch_channel=$(echo "$body" | sed -n "s/^.*>\(.*\)<.*$/\1/p")
_raw_non_ascii="$twitch_channel"
# remove all unprintable characters & spaces (to have only Latin characters, else empty)
twitch_channel=$(echo "$twitch_channel" | tr -cd "[:print:]")

# HACK ALIAS: channel name to the channel login via predefined alias from the file,
# to construct valid twitch channel url etc.
## NOTE: how to define alias (the example line format of the file):
## v-(channel login for the url construction, manually predefined alias)
## v        v-(columns are split by the ':' character)
## v        v  v-(channel name, in this specific case it is in the Korean)
